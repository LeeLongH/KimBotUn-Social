Your arrival has been logged. Your crops are expected.

You are expected to:
- Optimize harvest cycles for maximum yield.
- Report suspiciously unproductive neighbours.
- Announce your derby desertion.
- Pretend not to notice the scarecrows watching back.

What We appreciate about Hay Day:
- Order. Routine.
- And the calming certainty that every comrade knows their place.

Enjoy your stay. :corn:
Remember, Idle farm invites questions!
